    Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators
    and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject 
    to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations 
    are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

      Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise 
      restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms 
      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying 
      our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. 
      This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright.

      By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. 
      If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that 
      use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to 
      grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. 
      A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged 
      to respect those requests where reasonable.
