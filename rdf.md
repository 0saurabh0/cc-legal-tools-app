## Changes

### Overview

The changes between the old legacy ccEngine RDF/XML and the new CC Legal Tools
App  RDF/XML aim to enhance clarity, accuracy, compatibility, and
standardization of the RDF representation of Creative Commons licenses.  The
improvements enhance the machine-readability and semantic understanding of the
licenses, enabling better integration and interpretation within digital
ecosystems. A general overview of what and why changes occured:


#### Improved Structure and Consistency

- What: The structure of the RDF/XML files has been improved for better
  clarity, consistency, and adherence to RDF standards.
- Why: A well-defined and consistent structure makes it easier for machines to
  process and interpret the RDF data accurately.
- Diff: The newer generated RDF/XML have a more organized and standardized
  structure compared to the older legacy RDF/XML, ensuring that elements and
  properties are consistently represented.


#### Updated License Information

- What: License information and conditions have been updated for some of the
  licenses.
- Why: Keeping license information up-to-date ensures that users and automated
  systems are aware of the current permissions and restrictions associated with
  the licenses.
- Diff: The newer generated RDF/XML include the most recent and updated license
  Information.


#### Alignment with RDF Best Practices

- What: Changes have been made to align the RDF/XML representation with best
  practices and recommendations in the RDF.
- Why: Following best practices ensures that the RDF data is structured in a
  way that maximizes interoperability and compatibility with other
  RDF-consuming applications.
- Diff: The newer generated RDF/XML adhere to established RDF conventions, such
  as using standardized namespaces, consistent naming conventions, and properly
  defined relationships.


### Version 1.0.0 RDF/XML Changes

Fixed wrong `cc:deprecatedOn` on the following legal tools:
- CC Sampling+ 1.0 BR
- CC Sampling+ 1.0 DE
- CC Sampling+ 1.0 TW
- CC Sampling+ 1.0

Updated RDF namespace
- `dcterms` replaced `dc` and `dcq`

- CC BY-ND 2.1 CA
- CC BY 2.1 CA
- CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 AM
- CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AM

- CC BY 3.0 GE

Removed legacy ccEngine RDF/XML for nonexistent license:
- ~~CC BY-ND-NC 2.0 JP~~

Added additional [DCMI: DCMI Metadata Terms][dcmiterms] to RDF/XML:
- `dcterms:LicenseDocument` (duplicates `cc:legalcode`)
- `dcterms:Jurisdiction` with `rdf:datatype="http://purl.org/dc/terms/ISO3166"`
  (duplicates `cc:jurisdiction` except for `igo` which uses `un`)

Improved multilingual support:
- Title translations now match legal code
- Added `xml:lang` to `cc:legalcode`
- Removed top level `rdf:Description` that were redundant with `cc:legalcode`
  and `dcterms:LicenseDocument`

Remove third-party license RDF/XML (the deeds and legal code were replaced by
redirects long ago):
- `/licenses/BSD/rdf`
- `/licenses/GPL/2.0/rdf`
- `/licenses/LGPL/2.1/rdf`
- `/licenses/MIT/rdf`
- `/licenses/by-nd-nc/2.0/jp/rdf`

Remove unused RDF/XML files:
- `/rdf/jurisdictions.rdf`
- `/rdf/selectors.rdf`
